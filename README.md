## System Architecture and Approach

The project follows a modular design comprising several key components:

| Component                | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Management**      | Loads bond, cash flow, and company data from CSV files on Google Drive.                                                                                                                 |
| **Query Processing**     | Analyzes user queries, extracts vital details (e.g., ISIN numbers, company names), and identifies the type of information needed (bond details, cash flows, yield calculations, etc.). |
| **LLM Integration**      | Integrates GROQ's language models to generate context-driven, natural language responses based on extracted query information.                                                          |
| **Web Search Capability**| Uses the DuckDuckGo Search API to scrape and parse web data when local information is not sufficient.                                                                                   |
| **Interactive UI**       | Implements an interactive interface using Streamlit, complete with chat history, data loading statuses, and configuration options.                                                       |

## Setup and Configuration

- **Library Imports:** The application begins by importing necessary libraries and initializing session state variables.
- **Session State Management:** Stores chat history, bond details, cash flow information, and company insights.
- **Configuration Options:** Users can input their GROQ API key, specify Google Drive URLs for CSV files, and adjust AI model settings (e.g., temperature, max tokens) via the sidebar.

---

## Data Loading

The project handles data loading from Google Drive CSV files in a multi-step process:

- **Extract File ID:** Uses `get_file_id_from_url` to extract the file ID from a Google Drive URL.
- **Download and Read CSV:** Employs `load_csv_from_drive_url` via the gdown library to download and read CSV files.
- **Validate CSV Content:** Uses `validate_csv_file` to ensure files have the required columns.
- **Manage Data Loading:** Integrates these functions in `load_data_from_drive` to automatically adjust case-sensitive columns and load bond, cash flow, and company data.

---

## Query Processing

When the user enters a query, the application:

- **Analyzes Query Intent:** Determines if the query pertains to bond details, cash flow, yield calculations, or company information.
- **Extracts Key Data:** Retrieves key pieces of information (such as ISIN numbers, prices, or company names).
- **Formats Data for AI:** Prepares the query and accompanying data for processing by the language model.
- **Specialized Actions:** Processes bond queries, identifies cash flow schedules, calculates yields using bond coupon rates and prices, and fetches company insights as needed.

---

## Response Generation

The chatbot generates responses using the following steps:

- **Context Creation:** Constructs a context object that aggregates all relevant data.
- **Language Model Invocation:** Passes the context and a predefined prompt template to the language model.
- **Formatting:** Generates and formats the response using Markdown, then appends it to the chat history.

---

## Web Interface

The chatbotâ€™s user interface is built on Streamlit and includes:

- **Welcome Message:** An introductory message with example queries.
- **Data Loading Status:** Visual indicators to display the status of data uploads and validations.
- **Chat Interface:** A dynamic chat field paired with a history log for ongoing conversation tracking.
- **Debug Information:** Optional debug outputs to assist during development or troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

The Tap Bonds AI Chatbot Project is a comprehensive tool combining data management, intelligent query processing, and an interactive interface to provide valuable bond market analysis. Its modular design ensures scalability and ease of customization, making it a robust solution for real-time financial data insights.
